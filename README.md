# 🦀 100 Rust Projects Challenge

Welcome to my **#100RustProjects** journey! I am building and shipping 100 Rust projects to learn the language deeply, become a better Rust programmer, and have fun along the way. I'm learning in public and sharing everything I build here — one project, one day at a time.

---

## 📌 What is This?

This repository contains **100 small-to-medium Rust projects**. Each project lives in its own folder with a clear structure and explanation. The goal is to:

- Learn core Rust concepts by building
- Create a strong portfolio of practical projects
- Stay consistent for 100 days
- Build in public and connect with the Rust community

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Each project follows this folder structure:

```
100-rust-projects/
├── README.md
├── progress.md ← Project log and status tracker
├── notes/ ← Daily reflections, learnings, and resources
│ ├── project_001_hello_world.md
│ ├── project_002_guessing_game.md
│ └── ...
├── projects/ ← Code for each project
│ ├── project_001_hello_world/
│ ├── project_002_guessing_game/
│ └── ...

```

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

Throughout this challenge, I’ll explore:
- Rust basics: ownership, lifetimes, error handling
- CLI development
- Web servers & REST APIs
- Async programming
- File & data handling
- Using crates like `tokio`, `serde`, `clap`, `actix`, and more
- WebAssembly (WASM)
- Systems programming patterns
