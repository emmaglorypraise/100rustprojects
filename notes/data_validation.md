# Project 028 â€“ Error Handling Demo

## What I Built
A Rust CLI tool that validates user input (like emails, phone numbers, and passwords) using regular expressions. 

## What I Learned
This project introduces Rust regex handling, pattern matching, and designing input validators for real-world apps and forms.

## Notes
Add to Cargo.toml:
```
regex = "1.10"
```
