# Project 031 – Plugin System with Traits

## What I Built
A lightweight plugin system using Rust traits and dynamic dispatch.

## What I Learned

## Notes
I defined a common trait (Plugin) and allow multiple “plugins” to implement it. This project teaches trait objects, Box<dyn Trait>, and extensible architecture design.
