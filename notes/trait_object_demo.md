# Project 034 – Trait Object Demo (Dynamic Behavior Switching)


## What I Built
A CLI that selects a "mode" (e.g., Friendly, Sarcastic, or Formal) and uses a trait to define a consistent interface for all behaviors. This mimics polymorphic bots, plugins, or modular AI responses. This project demonstrates dynamic behavior switching at runtime using trait objects.
The user can:
- Switch greeting mode (1, 2, 3)
- Greet with their name (4)
- Exit (5)

## What I Learned

## Notes
Traits are like interfaces in other languages—they define behavior that types can implement.
