# Project 057 â€“ Text Editor (Mini Editor)

## What I Built
A basic text editor in the terminal using Rust. You can open, edit, and save text files line-by-line. This project introduces file I/O, string manipulation, and creating a stateful interactive CLI tool.

## What I Learned


## Notes
- `BufReader` and `.lines()` for file reading.

- `File::create()` and `writeln!()` for saving.
