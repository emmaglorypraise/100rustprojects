# Project 041 â€“ Concurrency-Based Data Processing

## What I Built
A Rust program that uses multiple threads to process chunks of data (like numbers or strings) concurrently and then collects the results. This project ties together Arc, Mutex, thread, and data partitioning to simulate a parallel map operation.
