# Project 027 â€“ Logger Utility

## What I Built
A simple logging utility CLI that writes timestamped messages to a log file. 

## What I Learned
Add this to Cargo.toml under dependencies:
```
chrono = "0.4"
```
## Notes
This project teaches  how to use timestamps, append mode file writing, and organize log levels like INFO, WARN, and ERROR.
