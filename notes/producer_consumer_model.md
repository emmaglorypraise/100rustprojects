# Project 039 â€“ Producer-Consumer Model

## What I Built
A simple producer-consumer system in Rust using multi-threading and channels. This project teaches inter-thread communication, bounded queues, and task buffering using mpsc::sync_channel.

## What I Learned

## Notes
A design pattern where:
- Producer generates tasks/data
- Consumer processes tasks/data
- They communicate via a shared queue (channel in Rust)
