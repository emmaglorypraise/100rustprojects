# Project 060 – Remote File Sync Tool (Local Simulation)

## What I Built

A CLI tool that compares two directories and copies new or changed files from a "source" to a "destination", simulating one-way file synchronization. This project shows file system traversal, metadata comparison, and file copying—great for backup and sync systems.
