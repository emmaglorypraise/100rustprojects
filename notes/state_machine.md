# Project 023 â€“ Enum-Based State Machine

## What I Built
A simple state machine CLI  using an enum to represent states in a CLI wizard (e.g. signup process).

## What I Learned
It introduced me to finite-state machines, enum pattern matching, and clean state transitions, great for building wizards, chatbots, or protocol handlers.
