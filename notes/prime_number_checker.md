# Project 009 â€“ Prime Number Checker

## What I Built
A Rust CLI tool to check if a given number is prime. 

## What I Learned
Prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that cannot be exactly divided by any whole number other than itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).

## Notes
Added extra features including:
Acertain if it is a prime number and find all the prime number up to that number
