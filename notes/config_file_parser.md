# Project 025 – Config File Parser

## What I Built
A simple config file parser that reads a .ini or .toml-style text file and extracts key-value pairs into a Rust HashMap. 



## What I Learned

## Notes
I learned how to implement practical text parsing, real-world use of HashMap, and how to design tools for managing settings or secrets—perfect for backend services, CLI apps, and scripting tools.

#### Example config.txt:
```
# Server Configuration
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 8080
timeout = 30
; Debug settings
debug_mode = true
```
