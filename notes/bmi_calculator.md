# Project 006 â€“ BMI Calculator

## What I Built
A Rust CLI tool that calculates the Body Mass Index(BMI) based on a user's weight and height

## What I Learned
BMI Calculations:
BMI = weight(kgs)/height^2(m2)
Under weight =  BMI < 18.5
Normalweight = 18.5 - 24.9
Over weight = 25 - 29.9
Obesity = BMI >= 30
