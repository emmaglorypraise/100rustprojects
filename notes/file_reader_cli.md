# Project 014 â€“ File Reader CLI

## What I Built
A Rust CLI tool in Rust that reads a file and prints its contents. Add optional features like showing line numbers and searching for keywords within the file.

## What I Learned



## Notes
### How to Run:

Read full file:
```
cargo run sample.txt
```

Read with line numbers:

```
cargo run sample.txt --lines
```

Search for keyword:

```
cargo run sample.txt --search Rust
```

Search with line numbers:

```
cargo run sample.txt --lines --search Rust
```


Here's a simple and useful sample.txt file content you can use to test all features of this CLI tool

```
