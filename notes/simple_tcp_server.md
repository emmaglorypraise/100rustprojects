# Project 049 – Simple TCP Server
Description:

## What I Built
A TCP server in Rust that listens for incoming client connections and echoes back messages. This project introduces socket programming, threading per connection, and line-based I/O—a fundamental stepping stone to chat apps, APIs, and web servers.

## What I Learned

## Notes

##### Test with nc (Netcat):
```
nc 127.0.0.1 7878

```
Type a message and press Enter, you should see it echoed back.
