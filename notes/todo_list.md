# Project 010 â€“ To-Do List

## What I Built
A Rust CLI tool where users can add, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks.

## What I Learned
Prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that cannot be exactly divided by any whole number other than itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).

## Notes
- Serde is a framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data structures efficiently and generically.
- Serde_json is used to read and write json files
