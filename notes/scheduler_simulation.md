# Project 059 â€“ Scheduler Simulation

## What I Built
A simple job/task scheduler simulation in Rust. Each task has a name and delay, and the scheduler runs them with a delay-based simulation using std::thread::sleep. This teaches task queues, basic scheduling, and async thinking (without async code).

## What I Learned


## Notes
- `thread::sleep()` for simulating delay.

- `Instant::now()` for tracking elapsed time.

- `Vec<Task>` as a basic task queue.
