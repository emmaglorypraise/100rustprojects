# Project 032 â€“ Generic Sorting Algorithms

## What I Built
A Rust CLI  that implements a generic `Bubble Sort` and `Insertion Sort` for any list of items that implement the PartialOrd and Clone traits. 

## What I Learned
- How to write type-safe sorting logic and reuse it for both numbers and strings.


## Notes

##### What is Bubble Sort?
Bubble sort is a simple and uncomplicated sorting algorithm. It is a comparison-based sorting technique in which we need to compare adjacent elements, and if they are not in order, the elements are swapped.

##### What is Insertion Sort?
Insertion sort is an easy and uncomplicated sorting algorithm that constructs the conclusive sorted array one item at a time.
